## Template Usage Notes

This template provides:
- **Consistent structure** across all projects
- **Standardized data fields** for easy parsing
- **Clear hierarchy** (Epic → Story → Acceptance Criteria)
- **Parseable format** for automation
- **Universal applicability** across different project types

### How to Use:
1. Copy this template for each new project
2. Fill in the bracketed sections with project-specific information
3. Remove sections that don't apply to your project
4. Add custom sections as needed
5. Save with a descriptive filename (e.g., `project-name-prd.md`)

### For Automation:
- Use consistent formatting for easy parsing
- Keep acceptance criteria in a standardized format
- Maintain clear hierarchy for story relationships
- Use consistent metadata fields across all PRDs
