- [ ] No Jest worker process failures in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test execution time remains reasonable (< 30 seconds for AI tests)

**Test Cases**:
1. Run `npm test -- --testNamePattern="ai-session-service"` - should pass without exceptions
2. Run full test suite - no Jest worker failures
3. Run tests in parallel - no process conflicts
4. Run tests multiple times - consistent results
